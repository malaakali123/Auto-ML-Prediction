⚡ AutoML Web Application

Automated Machine Learning for Everyone

🎯 1. Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to automate the Machine Learning process.
Normally, in Data Science, model training, data cleaning, and parameter tuning take many hours. This system performs the same tasks automatically within seconds or minutes.

Even users with no coding knowledge can simply upload their dataset and generate the best AI model.

⚙️ 2. How It Works

The system works in four simple steps:
	1.	Upload Data:
The user uploads a CSV file (e.g., Sales Data, Patient Records).
	2.	Auto Processing (Magic Box):
	•	Automatically fills missing values.
	•	Converts text data into numerical form.
	•	Detects the problem type (Classification or Regression).
	3.	Auto Training:
	•	Trains multiple powerful models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
	•	Performs Hyperparameter Tuning to find the best settings.
	4.	Results & Leaderboard:
	•	Displays a Leaderboard showing the best-performing model.
	•	Shows graphs and visualizations for better understanding.

🚀 3. Key Benefits
	•	⏳ Time Saving: Tasks that take days with manual coding are completed in seconds.
	•	👨‍💻 No Coding Required: Non-technical users can build complex ML models.
	•	🤖 High Accuracy: Instead of one model, multiple models are tested to select the best.
	•	📊 Clear Visualization: Results are explained through charts, not just numbers.

🌍 4. Real-World Use Cases

This system can be used wherever data-driven decisions are required:
	•	Business: Sales forecasting and Customer Churn prediction.
	•	Healthcare: Disease prediction (e.g., Diabetes detection).
	•	Real Estate: House price prediction based on features like size and location.
	•	Students & Researchers: Quickly testing baseline models on new datasets.

🛠️ 5. Technology Stack
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS (Glassmorphism), JavaScript
	•	Backend: Python, Flask
	•	AI Engine: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost
	•	Visualization: Chart.js
